# rhel2centos

Convert a deployed RHEL 6.x or 7.x server to CentOS

## Description

Convert a deployed RHEL 6.x/7.x server to CentOS in less that 100 lines of bash! This will take an install of RHEL 6 or 7 and convert it to CentOS 6 or 7, respectively.  (NOTE: This is pretty 'hacky' so I wouldn't use the machine in production.)
